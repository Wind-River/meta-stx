Build:
---------------------------

Tasks:
- Build Runtime image
- Build Installer image

Build Runtime image:
---------------------------

Setup build environment with the following added to the bblayers.conf:

```

 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/poky/meta
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/poky/meta-poky
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/poky/meta-yocto-bsp
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-openembedded/meta-oe
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-openembedded/meta-filesystems
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-openembedded/meta-initramfs
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-openembedded/meta-networking
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-openembedded/meta-perl
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-openembedded/meta-python
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-openembedded/meta-webserver
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-openembedded/meta-gnome
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-virtualization
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-cloud-services
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-cloud-services/meta-openstack
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-intel
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-security
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-selinux
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-iot-cloud
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-python2
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-dpdk
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-stx/meta-stx-cloud
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-stx/meta-stx-distro
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-stx/meta-stx-flock
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-stx/meta-stx-integ
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-stx/meta-stx-virt
 ${LAYER_PATH}/layers/meta-anaconda

```

Edit conf/local.conf and set:

```
MACHINE = "intel-corei7-64"
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel = "linux-yocto"
IMAGE_FSTYPES = " tar.bz2"
IMAGE_FSTYPES = " tar.bz2 live"
LABELS_LIVE = "install"
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES ?= "debug-tweaks"
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES += "tools-sdk"
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES += "tools-debug"
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES += "package-management"
DISTRO = "poky-stx"
DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " anaconda-support"
```

Build target with:

```
bitbake stx-image-aio
```

Build Installer image:
---------------------------
Setup build environment with the bblayers.conf as in RunTime image.

Edit conf/local.conf and set:

```
CONF_VERSION = "1"
DISTRO = 'anaconda'
MACHINE = "intel-corei7-64"
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel = "linux-yocto-rt"
INSTALLER_TARGET_BUILD = "/<PATH_TO_RUNTIME_STX_PRJ_DIR>/build/"
INSTALLER_TARGET_IMAGE = "stx-image-aio"

```
Build installer target with:

```
bitbake stx-image-installer-aio

```

Use Case:
---------------------------

This layer currently limited to AIO simplex mode has been tested to provision on virtualized host as outlined at:
